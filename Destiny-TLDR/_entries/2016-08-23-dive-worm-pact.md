The Needle dove, with Aurash at the helm.  Near the very core of Fundament, they encountered the Leviathan, a massive beast guarding  what was locked away inside Fundament. The Leviathan spoke to the sisters of  their struggle as Krill and the war between the Sky and the Deep, the Form and the Formless. About how the Sky gives, and builds places safe for life, and the  Deep snuffs that life from existence.

The sisters argued with the Leviathan. The ancient  beast described the eternal struggle between the creation of life, and the  inevitable embrace of death. The beast pleaded to the sisters to abandon this  path of the Deep, and to return to their hard but just life. For this is the  way of the Sky. But Sathona, who had her Father´s familiar, echoed its words  and that it had kept them safe from Taox betrayal. She pledged to her sisters

Let us dive, oh sisters mine.

Ignoring the Leviathan’s pleas, they dove into the Deep.  There they found the Worm Gods.  Before them stood five giant Worms, Yul, Eir, Xol, Ur and Akka.  Yul spoke to Aurash and her sisters, describing how the Worms had been growing in their deep prison, calling out into the Galaxy for life to come to Fundament.  The Worms blamed the Leviathan and the Sky for the coming cataclysm that would end all life on Fundament.

The Worms offered the three sisters a deal they would later call the Worm Pact:  In exchange for taking one of the worm-spawn into their bodies, they would receive eternal life and potentially unlimited power … as long as they followed their true nature.  Aurash could never stop exploring, Xi Ro could never stop testing her strength and Sathona could never abandon her cunning.  As they pursued their desires, they would grow more powerful and their worms would grow hungrier.  If they should falter, their worms would consume them and they would die.

The sisters accepted the Worm Pact, and became the first Hive.  As their bodies grew and changed, they took new names - Auryx, Xivu Arath and Xavathun.  With their new power they would avenge their father and one day go on to ravage worlds and end billions of lives.
