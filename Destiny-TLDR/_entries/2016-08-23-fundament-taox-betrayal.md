Like much of the life on Fundament, the Krill were never meant to live there - they lived on one of several planets that collided with it and became supercontinents.  Few survived to the end of their ten-year natural lifespan.  Their king discovered that the moons of Fundament would soon align to destroy all life on their world.  Urged on by Taox, teacher to the king’s daughters, the Osmium Court judged him a senile old man and killed him.  The Osmium King had three daughters who might succeed him, but Taox judged them all unfit to rule and “volunteered” to rule as Regent.  The children were to be killed.

As he lay dying, the king warned his daughters - curious Aurash, brave Xi Ro and clever Sathona of the coming cataclysm.  Sathona stole her father’s dying familiar from his corpse, the white worm who had urged him to study the moon and stars.  The worm now counseled her on how to escape the kingdom and survive in the wilds of Fundament.

In time, the sisters discovered an intact derelict starship called the Needle.  Only Sathona knew that the “dead” worm had led them there, speaking only to her, had kept them alive to board it and learn its secrets.  Now it commanded her again:  Board the ship.  Dive down to the core of Fundament.
